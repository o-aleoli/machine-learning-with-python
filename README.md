# Machine Learning With Python course's projects

These are my projects from the FreeCodeCamp's Machine Learning With Python course.
In general, they use TensorFlow and Keras packages for machine learning models, and Pandas for ETL and statistical analysis.
The details on each project's planning, development, and troubleshooting are availble on Jupyter Notebooks (in PT-BR) at their respective folders.
Original files and problem descriptions are availble on [author's website (FreeCodeCamp)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/#machine-learning-with-python-projects).

## Rock Paper Scissors

On the course's first project, the player must win at least 60% of 1000 plays against four artificial intelligences.
In my approach, I first trained a recurrent neural network to correctly classify the opponent using its first 200 plays and then choose the correct strategy against it.
This approach were capable of winning the AI in 87% ~ 96% of the plays at the unit test.
